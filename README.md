## Personal Site for Kevin Whitaker

This is just something small and quick I use as a springboard to send people to view my work.
I don't generally do a "portfolio" site, since I have Github, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.

The THREE.js object is taken from [this codrops article](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2017/11/28/decorative-webgl-backgrounds/), and edited a bit.

The page also uses dynamic importing via Webpack to make sure mobile users never have to load
the expensive THREE.js code.
